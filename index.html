				<p>1. One course I've taken here at Bellevue College was <a href="https://www2.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/ANTH%26/100" target="_blank">Anthropology 100</a> otherwise known as Survery of Anthropology with professor Anthony Tessandori. I didn't know anything at all about Anthropology, but now I'm familiar with human ancestors, why we evolved to have certain features, and how languages are formed.<br>2. Another course I am now finishing is <a href="https://www2.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/PROG/109" target="_blank">Programming 109</a> with Adam Brehm. Again I didn't know anything at all about web development and now I feel pretty confident with the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>3. I am also about to finish <a href="https://www2.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/SOC%26/201" target="_blank">Sociology 201</a> with Susan Cox. To me this is a pretty easy class as it talks a lot about issues with poverty and education, and the class talks a lot about coming up with ideas. I didn't know much about macro and micro levels with these problems so that was something I learned.</p>
